# Tutorial

## Getting started

- While MCC Mod Brancher doesn't directly need Administrator privileges, creating symlinks do.

- If it's your first time running; it's recommended:
  - To run as admin - to avoid lots of elevation requests.
  - Your game files are restored to original
  - If backing up original game folders (only need to do the once) unlock game folders using [Lockhunter](https://lockhunter.com/) first.


## First run

When you first run MCC Mod Brancher, you are presented with a tabpage which allows you to backup the game folders.
To do this, double click on "Mod Backup" folder(s) you wish to backup - you will have to do this for each of the available folders.
